_Syzygium luehmannii_ (F.Muell.) L.A.S. Johnson 

#### These are the steps to assemble and annotate the diploid genome for _Syzygium luehmannii_(F.Muell.)L.A.S.Johnson.

A specimen was collected from a cultured plant on the 20 December 2022 by Peri Tobias, and is vouchered at the National Herbarium of New South Wales (NSW), voucher number NSW1124137. The plant was purchased from Buringar Nursery in 2018 and was grown from seed collected from either Wooyung or Billinudgel (NSW North Coast) parental plant. The voucher was made for genomic DNA research on myrtle rust impacts by the University of Sydney (plant number 50) and sequencing funded by Bioplatforms Australia. The plant is known to be highly susceptible to myrtle rust through controlled inoculations at the University of Sydney Plant Breeding Institute, Cobbitty, using the pandemic isolate (Au-3 glasshouse increased 622). The specimen is also susceptible to natural infection in the field as evidnet in the image below.

An original aim of the research was to build both a pathogen and host genome from a single sample with data from PacBio Sequel II and HiC data.  As the pathogen sequence output was too low, this was not possible and therefore the project changed to building a high quality reference genome and annotation for the plant species.
