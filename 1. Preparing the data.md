  #### Process
  
1. PacBio Sequel II ccs.bam file (17G) was downloaded 4 March 2023 and filtered of adaptors using HiFiAdapterFilt. Data available at NCBI accession: 
2. Ran NanoPlot on filtered data to check statistics.

- General summary:
- Mean read length:                11,370.9
- Mean read quality:                   40.3
- Median read length:              11,103.0
- Median read quality:                 39.1
- Number of reads:              2,214,940.0
- Read length N50:                 11,975.0
- Total bases:             25,185,858,588.0


3. Ramiacotti Centre for Genomics, UNSW, HiC paired-end fastq.gz data (using Phase Genomics library preparation kit) (47G) was downloaded on the 27 April 2023. Raw data available at NCBI accession: .
4. We mapped the data to the _Austropuccinia psidii_ genome available ([https://zenodo.org/records/6476632](url)) with minimap2 to separate plant from pathogen reads. We then processed .sam to .bam with samtools.

   
   ```
   minimap2 -d ${prefix_name}.mmi ${prefix_name}.fasta
   minimap2 -K 2g -t 8 -ax map-hifi -o $OUTDIR/${prefix_name}.sam -a ${prefix_name}.mmi ccs.filt.fastq.gz
   ```
   
5. Output from the mapping was VSD_unmapped.bam (20G) and VSD_mapped.bam (27M)
6. Parental Illumina data was available from previous work within our lab in 2021 by Gurpreet Singh ([https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/1c0ug48/alma991032323073205106](url)),  and is available at NCBI accessions: SRR28294700 (maternal S1 raw data) and SRR28294699 (paternal RUQ1347 raw data). This data was trimmed of adaptors and low quality reads using fastp in default mode.
7. We proceeded with the unmapped reads (_Syzygium luehmannii_) to build the genome.
